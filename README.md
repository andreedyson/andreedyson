### 🧑‍💻 My Coding Journey
My journey into the world of coding began at the age of 10 when I received my first laptop. This ignited my passion for exploring the internet and watching videos. By 8th grade, I was introduced to HTML in a Computer class, which marked the official start of my coding adventure. I quickly became fascinated with building websites, fueling my ambition to become a Front-End Web Developer.

I started by mastering HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and soon advanced to technologies like React and Next.js through various projects. Today, I have expanded my expertise to include advanced tech stacks such as Next.js, TypeScript, Prisma, and PostgreSQL. These skills enable me to create fully functional websites that are not only visually appealing but also user-friendly and robust. My journey continues as I strive to integrate these technologies to deliver comprehensive and efficient web solutions.
